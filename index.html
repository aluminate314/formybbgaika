    Hi Aika. I made this specifically for you because it has been bothering me from time to time now<br>
    how I didn't get to properly give a response the last we talked about this. But anyways, two things<br>
    I wanna mention here.<br><br>
    
    First off, I want to apologize for oversharing the shit that has happened to me and you know who.<br>
    I was always updating you with the shit that was happening to us even though that stuff shouldn't<br>
    really be shared even to your closest and most trusted friend. But I'm also scared because I<br>
    realized what I've done. So please promise me never to speak of anything you know about me and<br>
    him to anyone and just forget I told you things in the first place :'>  Don't worry too much with<br>
    what will happen to us though as I know our boundaries.<br><br>

    Secondly, the thing about us drifting apart. Heavy topic. Spent an entire evening sobbing my eyes out<br>
    trying to reflect and think about this. When you said that you were closer to Marcus than you were<br>
    with me, I felt jealous and hurt, so I couldn't rationalize myself during those times. But now that<br>
    I've got time to think, I just want to let you know that it's ok. It's ok if you don't feel like I'm<br>
    the first person you should dm when you see some crazy shit. It's ok if you're close with someone else<br>
    other than me, because we're just having our own social lives. Don't force yourself to talk to me if<br>
    you ain't in the mood to. But this doesn't mean that I am saying goodbye, no no. We're still friends<br>
    of course, I'm just slowly coming to accept that things do change. And it doesn't make us any less<br>
    friends. Our memories will live on in my mind, and I'll still cherish them. However, it's totally<br>
    ok if you decide to create new ones without me. Either way, I will be supporting you like I've always<br>
    done and I'll be here for you if you need someone to listen. Ah shit I am starting to tear up as I<br>
    write this. I just didn't expect shit to change between us so drastically. It had to be you, of all<br>
    people. You're right, this is like Kyo's situation. It took me a long while to understand and accept<br>
    that our friendship can never get back the way it was, but I'm no longer hurt with Kyo. So I hope you<br>
    and me would be ok too with our situation. Again, this is not goodbye, this is simply a reflection.<br>
    I'll still be messaging you like normal. I just feel like I had to get that off my chest. Remember<br>
    I'll always love you and see you as my family and soulmate :'><br><br>
